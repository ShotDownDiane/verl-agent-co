  "task_description": "We are tasked with determining the optimal location for a new electric vehicle (EV) charging station to maximize benefits by effectively meeting demand.",
  "data_schema": "- Coverage: The expected coverage of the charging station after placement.\n- Demand: The number of nearby vehicles requiring charging.\n- Distance: The average distance to nearby existing charging stations.\n- Waiting Time: The average waiting time at nearby existing charging stations. NaN indicates no station nearby and the highest waiting time.\n- Charging Time: The average charging time at nearby existing charging stations. NaN indicates no station nearby and with the highest charging time.",
  "domain_knowledge": "- Higher expected coverage indicates a more sufficient supply after placement.\n- Higher demand suggests greater potential benefits.\n- Longer average distance to existing charging stations indicates a greater need for new stations nearby.\n- You MUST first prioritize maximizing coverage, while reducing overall travel, waiting, and charging time is of secondary importance.",
  "task_target": "identify which location would deliver the most substantial benefits for an EV charging station, focusing on enhancing overall station coverage, minimizing overall travel time, reducing overall waiting time, and reducing overall charging time. You can ONLY select one location to build the new station.",
  "task_output_type": "decision",
  "action_space": "- A: Create by coverage: Select the node with the lowest coverage and create a new charging station.\n - B: Create by demand: Select the node with the highest weakened demand and create a new charging station.\n- C: Add by coverage: Add one charger to an existing station selected by lowest coverage.\n- D: Add by demand: Add one charger to an existing station selected by highest demand.\n- E: Relocate charger: Move one charger from the lowest-benefit station to the station with the highest waiting and charging time."
