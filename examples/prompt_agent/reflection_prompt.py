SELF_REFLECTION_FEW_SHOT = """Example 1:
query:
What is the capital of France?
answer:
Florida
evaluation feedback:
FAIL: The answer is incorrect. The capital of France is Paris, not Florida.
self-reflection:
The answer is incorrect because I confused the capital of France with a US state. The correct capital of France is Paris, as indicated in the feedback. I should ensure to recall geographical facts accurately in the next attempt.

Example 2:
query:
Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms.
answer:
It's a theory by Einstein.
evaluation feedback:
FAIL: The answer is too vague and lacks explanation. The theory of relativity should be explained in simple terms, covering concepts like space, time, and gravity.
self-reflection:
The answer failed because it was too brief and did not provide a simple explanation of the theory of relativity. I need to elaborate on key concepts such as how space and time are interconnected and how gravity affects them, as suggested by the feedback."""
